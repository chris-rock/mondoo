# Alerting

To ensure thay you always have the most recent risk information, Mondoo supports integration into various communication tools. It supports two event types:

* asset risk alert - is send when an asset risk score has changed
* weekly email risk report - a weekly risk summary of all your spaces in your organization

Mondoo's alert notifications are delivered via email by default but can be configured to be routed via our integrations. To activate messenger alerts for your Mondoo space, you will need to configure the specific space integration.
